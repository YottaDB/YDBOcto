   :depth: 4

-------------------------
Error Message Severities
-------------------------

The error message severities are:

* TRACE
* INFO
* DEBUG
* WARNING
* ERROR
* FATAL

Comparative to severities in PostgreSQL,

* TRACE, INFO and WARNING are equivalent to PSQL INFO.
* DEBUG is equivalent to PSQL DEBUG.
* ERROR is equivalent to PSQL ERROR.
* FATAL is equivalent to PSQL FATAL.

TRACE and DEBUG are used to get helpful output for debugging. INFO provides potentially helpful, but non-critical information about internal operation. WARNING is similar to INFO, but highlights potentially dangerous or undesirable, though non-critical, behavior. ERROR messages report disruptive but recoverable states. Note that ERRORs encountered while parsing or executing a query will cause it to fail. FATAL messages indicate disruptive, unrecoverable states and cause the program to immediately exit, closing any open network connection.

---------------------
Octo or Rocto Errors
---------------------

Octo or Rocto Errors are of the form :code:`ERR_<error>` or :code:`INFO_<error>` or :code:`WARN_<error>`. These errors can occur in either :code:`octo` or :code:`rocto`. The errors are detailed below, in alphabetical order. Occurrences of "xxx" indicate portions of the error message text that vary depending on the details of the particular error.

ERR_READWRITE_DISALLOWED
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Text: READWRITE keyword in CREATE TABLE is disallowed due to an incompatible keyword

Description/Action: This error is generated when a CREATE TABLE command specifies the table type to be READWRITE but also specifies another keyword that is incompatible with READWRITE. A table level GLOBAL keyword is compatible if it specifies just an unsubscripted M global name followed by subscripts that only correspond to primary key columns (using the :code:`keys(...)` syntax). Otherwise it is considered incompatible. A column level PIECE keyword is compatible if it is specified for a non-key column and the piece number matches the number of this non-key column (starting from one(1) from the leftmost non-key column in the CREATE TABLE command). Otherwise it is considered incompatible. A column level EXTRACT, GLOBAL, DELIM, START, STARTINCLUDE or END keyword is considered incompatible. There is one exception to this rule and that is a table with only one non-key column that also has a column level :code:`DELIM ""` specified. This is considered compatible. This error is also generated in some cases when a CREATE TABLE command does not specify the table type to be READWRITE or READONLY but specifies a keyword that is incompatible with READWRITE and a default table type of READWRITE is assumed. In such cases, explicitly specifying the table type as READONLY would fix the error. PSQL Error Code: 42601
