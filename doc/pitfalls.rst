Fixing out of sync cross reference
-----------------------------------

  To speed up query execution, Octo automatically builds cross references for every *<table_name, column_name>* pair as needed. It has been observed that in rare cases (see `YottaDB/DB/YDB/#659 <https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/DB/YDB/-/issues/659>`_ for details) the cross references can get out of sync. If you encounter such a situation, run the following command to rebuild the cross reference for a particular *<table_name, column_name>* pair.

  .. code-block:: bash

     $ $ydb_dist/yottadb -run %XCMD 'KILL ^%ydboctoocto("xref_status","*<table_name>*","*<column_name>*")'

  The above command invalidates the current cross reference.

  Run your original query, in Octo, to rebuild/fix the cross reference.
