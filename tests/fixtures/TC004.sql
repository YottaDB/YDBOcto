-- TC004 : recreate a cached table and check that the cached version is deleted

-- Need READONLY below as we do not want the DROP TABLE to delete ^T1 as the following queries rely on ^T1 persisting.

CREATE TABLE t1 (a int primary key) GLOBAL "^T1(keys(""A""))" READONLY;
SELECT * FROM t1;
DROP TABLE t1;
CREATE TABLE t1 (a int primary key, b int) GLOBAL "^T1(keys(""A""))" READONLY;
SELECT * FROM t1;
DROP TABLE t1;
CREATE TABLE t1 (a int primary key, b int, c int) GLOBAL "^T1(keys(""A""))" READONLY;
SELECT * FROM t1;
DROP TABLE t1;
CREATE TABLE t1 (a int primary key, b int, c int, d int) GLOBAL "^T1(keys(""A""))" READONLY;
SELECT * FROM t1;
DROP TABLE t1;
