# Change shell prompt to something other than "$" or "#" as that is a substring of many YDB/Octo prompts
# and can cause incorrect match later when we wait for the shell prompt.
# Note: Changing the shell prompt to SHELL might seem easily achieved as follows.
#	send -- "PS1=SHELL\r"

# But that will not work because it is possible the "expect" matches the SHELL from the "PS1=SHELL" input.
# To avoid this, we first store the "SHELL" string in a variable and use that to set the prompt.
