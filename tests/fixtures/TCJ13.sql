-- TCJ13 : OCTO769 : Speed up CROSS JOIN by rearranging FROM/JOIN even if OR is used in WHERE clause

-- This is a query in tests/fixtures/sqllogic/select4.test (which gets run as part of the test_sqllogic/TS04 bats subtest
-- if this query gets randomly chosen from the many queries in that file) that used to take 15 minutes to run.
-- After the YDBOcto#769 fixes to rearrange CROSS JOIN independently for each DNF plan, it takes less than a second to run.
