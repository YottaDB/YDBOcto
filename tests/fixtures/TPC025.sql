-- TPC025 : OCTO597 : Test pg_settings xrefs are updated when value changed via SET command

-- Retrieve row for initial (default) value of a setting, i.e. DateStyle, to create a cross reference
select name, setting from pg_settings where setting = 'ISO, YMD';

-- Change the value to invalidate previously created cross reference
set datestyle = 'ISO';

-- Run the previous to confirm cross reference was invalidated, i.e. no results returned
select name, setting from pg_settings where setting = 'ISO, YMD';

-- Run query for the new value to generate new cross reference and confirm correct value
select name, setting from pg_settings where setting = 'ISO';
