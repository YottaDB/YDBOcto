-- TTA003 : OCTO759 : TABLENAME.ASTERISK in GROUP BY should not be expanded to list of table columns : Error scenarios

-- Test of ERR_GROUP_BY_OR_AGGREGATE_FUNCTION error
-- Below tests queries from https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/DBMS/YDBOcto/-/issues/759#note_732301265

-- Below queries are moved from TSCP14_table_asterisk.sql (note: this file was nixed as part of YDBOcto#759 changes)
-- They used to work before YDBOcto#759 code changes but issue an error (like Postgres) after then.
