# This is a pesky one, which I think is a bug in GCC10/ASAN5
# Signature looks like this:
#
# Direct leak of 40 byte(s) in 1 object(s) allocated from:
#    #0 0x7f2e641abba8 in __interceptor_malloc (/lib64/libasan.so.5+0xefba8)
#    #1 0x473002 in alloc_chunk (/opt/yottadb/current/plugin/octo/bin/octo+0x473002)
#
# Indirect leak of 729 byte(s) in 1 object(s) allocated from:
#    #0 0x7f2e641abdb0 in calloc (/lib64/libasan.so.5+0xefdb0)
#    #1 0x47304d in alloc_chunk (/opt/yottadb/current/plugin/octo/bin/octo+0x47304d)
#
# It's correct that there are leaks, but these all come from find_function,
# find_table, which are already excluded above. This solution is the best I can
# come up with now.
