# Create a user-defined table (by loading names.sql)
# Set ^%ydboctoocto("seeddfnfmt") to 6 (before YDBOcto#929 changes)
# Start octo which will automatically run auto upgrade due to previous step
# We expect no errors in this step
# This step used to previously issue an ERR_DUPLICATE_PRIMARY_KEY_CONSTRAINT error
# Also verify that tables/function that were added to octo-seed.sql after YDBOcto#929 (23b2d60c) are still there

-- TC080 : OCTO929 : Test that repeated auto upgrade runs work fine with user defined tables

-- Below queries verify that tables/function that were added to octo-seed.sql after YDBOcto#929 (23b2d60c) are still there
-- We take one representative function and table.
