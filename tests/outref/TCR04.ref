# Test cancel request for INSERT INTO
# Generate names tables with 1 million rows
# Above step also generates TCR04.sql which has an INSERT INTO query to insert 1 million new rows
# Run TCR04.sql through psql and cancel query; Expect number of rows to still be 1 million afterwards
ydb=# # Run INSERT INTO query that takes a long time to run so we can Ctrl-C it and verify if CancelRequest processing occurs
insert into names select id+1000000,firstname,lastname from names;
# Send interrupt to trigger cancel request
^CCancel request sent
ERROR:  canceling statement due to user request
ydb=# # Run another query to verify queries after a Ctrl-C of INSERT INTO work fine and canceled query left db in clean state
select count(*) from names;
 count(*)

  1000000
(1 row)

ydb=# \q
# Verify no partial updates from INSERT INTO
