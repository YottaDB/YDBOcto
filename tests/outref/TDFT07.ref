-- TDFT07 : OCTO54 : Test DELETE FROM and INSERT INTO after xref plan files get deleted issues ZLINKFILE error

INSERT INTO names SELECT id+2 FROM names ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 2;

-- Since all of the below queries are expected to issue ZLINKFILE error, take this opportunity to
-- run couple of DELETE FROM queries, the latter of which exposed an incorrectly coded assert in
-- qualify_column_name.c (which has since been fixed).
DELETE FROM names n1 WHERE n1.id IN (SELECT n2.id FROM names n2 ORDER BY n2.id DESC LIMIT 2);
DELETE FROM names WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM names ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 2);
