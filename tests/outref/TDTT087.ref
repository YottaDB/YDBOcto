# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# This test takes a randomly generated date/time/timestamp literal.
# Finds its equivalent in different formats (fileman/horolog etc.).
# Sets these literals as node values in different globals.
# Does this 10 times so each global has 10 nodes.
# Maps these globals to different READONLY tables.
# Each table defines the column as date, date(fileman), date(horolog) etc. type.
# It then generates queries to do JOIN on those tables with an ON condition that checks for the timestamp column values to be equal across the tables.
# Since it is possible the randomly generated date/time/timestamp values can in rare cases match, the test expects at least as many (cannot be equal to) rows of values returned as the rows in the tables (i.e. >= 10).
# And because the select column list of the query is the condition count(joined rows) >= 10, we expect a value of 1 to show up in each of the 4 randomly generated JOIN queries.
# And that is part of the reference file.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Load M data for READONLY tables that will be created in next step
# Use randomly generated date/time/timestamp literals for this purpose
# Generate CREATE TABLE commands for READONLY tables and SELECT queries that do JOINs on those READONLY tables
# Run CREATE TABLE commands for READONLY tables
# Run SELECT commands for READONLY tables involving JOINs
# Verify output of 4 SELECT commands involving JOINs
# Expect output of all 4 SELECT commands to be 1
