-- In this case it might be more user-friendly to assume READONLY and not issue an error.
-- But ERR_READWRITE_DISALLOWED error is how Octo behaves currently (as it assumed READWRITE to create the hidden
-- key column initially and cannot easily change that to READONLY later) and so we test that here.
