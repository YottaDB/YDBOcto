-- Basic test
select * from names group by 1;
select n1.* from names n1 group by 1;

-- Following three queries check if literal in an expression present in GROUP BY and SELECT list is different
-- then the query errors out.
select lastname = 'Zero' from names group by lastname = 'Cool';
select lastname = 'Zero', count(lastname) from names group by lastname = 'Cool';
select TRUE!=((lastname='Cool')!=TRUE) from names group by TRUE!=((lastname='Zero')!=TRUE);
-- Following query checks if an error is thrown when expression is present reversed in GroupBy
select 'Cool' = lastname, count(lastname) from names group by lastname = 'Cool';

-- The following query demonstrates that if a column in select column list is not present
--  in GROUP BY as a individual node we through an error
select firstname from names group by firstname!='Cool';

-- Following query will generate error as expected.
-- Reason: `lastname` present in SELECT list is not present in GroupBy
select * from names group by id,firstname,1+id;

-- Constants other than INTEGER is not allowed similar to postgres
select 1 + 0 from names group by 'Zero';
select 'Zero' from names group by 'Zero';

-- The following queries generate error because expression or column in SELECT LIST is not present in GroupBy
select firstname = 'Zero', count(firstname) from names group by not firstname = 'Zero';
select id from names group by id not in (1,2);
select firstname is null,count(firstname) from names group by lastname is null;
select firstname from names group by firstname not in ('Cool','Zero');

-- Following queries validate that queries with multiple occurences of same node in GroupBy work fine
select 1+1 from names group by 1,1,1,2;

-- All the below queries are expected to throw errors as neither the columns
-- nor sub-expressions corresponding to both columns nor the entire expression holding both the columns
-- in SELECT list is present in GroupBy
select firstname != lastname from names group by firstname;
select ('Cool' != firstname)=('Zero' != lastname) from names group by firstname;
select ('Cool' != firstname)=('Zero' != lastname) from names group by 'Cool'!=firstname;
select firstname != lastname from names group by lastname != firstname;

-- Below query used to generate an assert failure in hash_canonical_query() call from qualify_statement()
SELECT id,firstname FROM names n1 WHERE id IN (SELECT 1!=(n1.id=0) FROM names n2 group by 1!=(n1.id=0::int));

-- Below queries test that ERR_TYPE_MISMATCH in Boolean operation is caught in GroupBy
select firstname=id from names group by firstname=id;
-- This query will throw a ERR_GROUP_BY_OR_AGGREGATE_FUNCTION as the select column expression or the participating columns are not in GroupBy.
select firstname=id from names group by firstname=1;
-- This query shows that if a query get past the expression related GroupBy validation the checks in populate_data_type()
-- are still performed and will result in any ERR_TYPE_MISMATCH errors.
select firstname=1 from names group by firstname=1;

-- Below queries test that aggregate functions are not allowed in GroupBy
select count(n1.*) from names as n1 group by count(n1.*);
select count(n1.*) from names as n1 group by 1;
select (1+count(id)) from names group by 1;
select count(n1.*) from names as n1 group by 1!=avg(n1.id);
select 1 from names as n1 group by 1!=count(n1.firstname);

-- Below queries refer to an invalid column number in GroupBy
select firstname from names group by 2;

-- Below queries test CASE statements
select CASE n1.id+1 WHEN 2 THEN 1 END  from names n1 group by n1.id+2 having CASE n1.id+1 WHEN 2 THEN TRUE END;
select count(n1.*) from names n1 group by n1.id+2 having CASE n1.id+1 WHEN 2 THEN TRUE END;
select count(n1.*) from names n1 group by n1.id+2 having CASE count(n1.id)+id WHEN 2 THEN TRUE END;
select 1 from names n1 group by n1.id+2 having CASE 2 WHEN n1.id+1 THEN TRUE END;
