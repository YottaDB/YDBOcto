-- TSD04 : SELECT DISTINCT should issue error if ORDER BY expression does not appear in SELECT column list

-- All queries in this query file are invalid queries and generate an error both in Octo and Postgres.

SELECT DISTINCT firstname FROM names ORDER BY lastname;
SELECT DISTINCT firstname,lastname FROM names ORDER BY firstname,id;
-- A similar query as the below exists in TSD04_noerrors.sql and works fine there because it has `2+id AS id` there
-- which is a user-specified column name but here it only has `2+id` here and therefore takes on an implied column
-- alias of `id`. The ORDER BY id would only match user specified alias names and not implied alias names.
SELECT DISTINCT 2+id,lastname FROM names ORDER BY id;
SELECT DISTINCT 2+id,lastname FROM names ORDER BY 2+id,firstname;
SELECT DISTINCT 2+id,lastname FROM names ORDER BY 2+id,firstname,lastname;
SELECT DISTINCT 2+id,lastname FROM names ORDER BY 2+id,lastname,firstname || 'abcd';
SELECT DISTINCT 2+id,firstname || 'abcd',lastname FROM names ORDER BY 3,3+id,2;
SELECT DISTINCT 2+id,firstname || 'abcd',lastname FROM names ORDER BY 2+id,firstname || 'abcd',lastname,firstname;

-- Test that `2+id` in SELECT column list is not the same as `id+2` in ORDER BY column list
SELECT DISTINCT 2+id,firstname || 'abcd' AS col2,lastname FROM names ORDER BY 3,id+2,2;

SELECT DISTINCT id,(SELECT n1.lastname FROM names n1 LIMIT 1),firstname FROM names ORDER BY id,(SELECT DISTINCT n2.lastname FROM names n2 LIMIT 1),firstname;
SELECT DISTINCT id,(SELECT n1.lastname FROM names n1 LIMIT 1),firstname FROM names ORDER BY id,(SELECT n2.lastname FROM names n2 ORDER BY n2.lastname LIMIT 1),firstname;

-- Test that (SELECT n1.lastname FROM names n1 LIMIT 1) is not same as (SELECT n2.lastname FROM names n2 LIMIT 1)
SELECT DISTINCT id,(SELECT n1.lastname FROM names n1 LIMIT 1),firstname FROM names ORDER BY id,(SELECT n2.lastname FROM names n2 LIMIT 1),firstname;

-- Test that alias difference does result in an error
