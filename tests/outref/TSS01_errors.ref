-- TSS01 : OCTO181 : Data types are not correctly propagated from nested SELECTs; Misc other queries

-- The below queries test that data types are correctly propagated from nested SELECTs
select * from names where id != firstname;
select * from (select * from names) n1 where id != firstname;

-- The below queries test that boolean expressions involving just "column" operands work (equivalent to "column != 0")
-- And issue errors if needed.

select (1 AND id) from names;
select (firstname AND id) from names;
select id and 0 = 1 from names;
select id and (0 = 1) from names;
select (0 = 1) and id from names;
select id and id from names;
select (firstname::boolean AND id::boolean) from names;

-- The below query issues an error in Postgres but works fine in Octo hence is not included in TSS01_noerrors.sql
