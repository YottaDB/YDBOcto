-- All queries in this query file are invalid queries and generate an error.

-- TSS21 : OCTO492 : SIG-11 from a query that also issues a <Subquery must return only one column> error

-- Below are queries that did generate a SIG-11 without the OCTO492 code fix
SELECT (SELECT 1,2);
SELECT 1 FROM names ORDER BY (SELECT 1,2);

-- Below are queries that did not SIG-11 previously but are very similar to the above queries that did SIG-11 so are included here
SELECT 1 FROM names WHERE 1 = (SELECT 1,2);
