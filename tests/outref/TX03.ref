# More than 1 region does not reproduce the issue (reasons not clear)
# Delete gld and 2 *.dat files created by createdb as part of setup() function
# Create 1 region database
# Need to set global buffers to a small value for the LRU clock algorithm (in "db_csh_getn" of YDB repo)
# to kick in and cause a self-inflicted restart.
# Create ^names1 and ^names2 globals with lots of nodes corresponding to the NAMES1 and NAMES2 tables
# But more importantly also set nodes in the same globals that are not part of the NAMES1/NAMES2 tables
# and that take up more space in the GDS block as this is necessary to cause a restart due to lack of
# global buffers ("cdb_sc_lostcr" in tp_hist.c).
# Note that two globals are needed to reproduce the original issue.
# It is not clear yet why that is the case but it is not considered important enough to investigate.
# Run SQL query TX03.sql that generates xref
[ WARN] Global ^%ydboctoxref maps to default region DEFAULT. Recommended mapping for ^%ydbocto* is to a separate region
