# Every subtest in this test is expected to have two parts:
# * First to be executed on the older commit
#   * For this part, the bats test is expected to have a `load_fixture file.sql` and a `verify_output file`. This creates the
#     necessary tables or functions.
#       For example:
#         Table A with its check constraint having a reference to the function abs(). This way, running file.sql will create
#         the required dependency nodes in the DB.
# * Second part to be executed by test-auto-upgrade job
#   * For this part, the bats test is expected to just copy over the query file and the reference file to the subtest directory.
#     These files will be later used by test-auto-upgrade job to run the test after an upgrade
#   * The queries that are expected here are those which validate that the dependencies which were created before upgrade
#     still exist.
#       For example:
#         Since the first part created a table which depends on function abs(), the query file to be executed after the upgrade
#         can have a drop function query on abs() and an error which says cannot drop as dependency exist in the reference file.
#         This will test that the upgrade didn't remove the dependency between the table and the function.
#
# While adding a new subtest to test_auto_upgrade.bats.in ensure that the naming of files are as follows:
# * Files should have names in the format subtestNamesubtestNumber_partNumber
#   * For example, TAU001_1.sql
#     * TAU is the name of the subtest
#     * 001 is the number of the subtest
#     * 1 represents the part of the test in which the file will be used in.
#
# In the test-auto-upgrade job, tools/ci/build.sh script is going to check if the test being run in the test-auto-upgrade job is
# a test_auto_upgrade test
# * In such case, it execute the second part of the test by running the second query file (TAU001_2.sql) in Octo and validates the
#   output by executing `diff` with the second reference file (TAU001_2.ref) of the subtest. It picks the second reference file
#   from the latest commit (not the older commit) so we don't copy the reference file in this test (tools/ci/build.sh takes care
#   of that while running with the latest commit). Hence the "cp ...TAU001_2.ref" line below is commented out.
