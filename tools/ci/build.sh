			# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
			# Exclude specific set of subtests (reasons explained below)
			# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
			# 1) The TC011 subtest used to have invalid queries which issue errors in later commits
			#    For example, "CREATE TABLE names (id NUMERIC(16,18) PRIMARY KEY ..." used to work fine before
			#    But would issue a "ERR_NUMERIC_SCALE" error due to the YDBOcto#636 fixes.
			#    Therefore, the output of octo against these queries using an older commit and the current commit
			#    could be different (depending on the randomly chosen older commit). And that in turn would
			#    cause the "test-auto-upgrade" pipeline job to signal a false failure. Therefore skip this subtest.
			# 2) The TPC019 subtest runs the query only with "rocto" and expects a ERR_ROCTO_QUERY_TOO_LONG error.
			#    The same error does not happen with "octo" (which means the query will run further along and
			#    terminate abnormally due to not enough "stacksize" limit) which is what this test will use.
			#    Therefore skip this subtest.
			# 3) The TQG03 subtest randomly chooses "nullcharnames" schema and before the YDBOcto#275 commit,
			#    it could use the "NULLCHAR" keyword in the "CREATE TABLE" command which is no longer supported
			#    after the YDBOcto#275 commit. Therefore the auto upgrade would issue a syntax error in that case
			#    as it sees an unsupported NULLCHAR keyword in the "NULLCHARNAMES" table's text definition.
			#    Therefore skip this subtest if the random older commit is prior to the YDBOcto#275 commit.
			# 4) All the TQG* subtests (TQG01, TQG02, TQG03, TQG04, TQG05, TQG06 as of now) could use the empty
			#    string in their queries if the older commit was prior to the YDBOcto#275 commit. Those queries
			#    could give different output in the newer build since the empty string will now be treated as NULL.
			#    Therefore, skip all TQG* subtests if the random older commit is prior to the YDBOcto#275 commit.
			#    Note that (3) is subsumed by (4) so just one check is needed below for both those cases.
			# 5) By a similar reasoning as (4), the TJC004/TJC005/TJC006/TJC007 subtests in the
			#    "test_jdbc_connection" test use the same query generator that the "TQG*" subtests use.
			#    And so need to be skipped for the same conditions as TQG*.
			# 6) By a similar reasoning, the TC027/TC033/TC034 subtests (in the "test_createtable" bats test) used
			#    "NULLCHAR" previously and so have to be skipped.
